<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>    LCC <em>Moose</em> team was established in 1995. Until 2007, the team competed in various local basketball tournaments such as Klaipeda Cup. 
In the beginning of 2007, LCC Board of Directors decided to lift LCC <em>Moose basketball</em> team to a higher level. The team was formed from players of different countries such as Lithuania, Senegal, Latvia and USA. From 2007 LCC <em>Moose</em> competed in RKL (Regional Basketball League) and LSKL (Students Basketball League). Due to the structural changes, the basketball program was put on hold and re-established in 2010 since then competes in RKL league. In 2010/2011 season team managed to finish their season in the 5th place.
In 2011/2012 season <em>Moose</em> just after a tough game was left behind the TOP 4 and finished their season in the 5th place by repeating previous season achievement. Next two seasons for <em>Moose</em> did not fulfill expectations of the fans as the team finished only 5-8 in RKL. However, in 2014-2015 season<em>Moose</em> showed what it is made of, as it finished 3rd in the league. Next season was even better in terms of win/loss ratio, as the team finished regular season 2nd, just few points behind Akmene. In mid season, the team won LKF cup 3rd place; however, this was the last award for <em>Moose</em> until now. </p>
